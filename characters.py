#COMMENT1: when i type the first and second character for ex. q and M, I don't see any unusual things other than 
#           associated characters which are > and $ .
#COMMENT2: when I type more than two characters, some unusual errors occur stating that the def main is incorrect or
#           something like that. 
# When I did the assignment I didnt have access to internet for some reason so I couldn't research the problem on google, sorry...
#           Will check the problem at school during the week...
